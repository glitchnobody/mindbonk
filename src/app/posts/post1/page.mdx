    Cognitive Load

    - Short Description: The total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.
    - Problem: The large image with text overlay might be contributing to a high cognitive load, making it difficult for users to quickly understand the site's purpose.
    - Solution: Reduce the cognitive load by using a clear headline and subheadline that explain the site's purpose without requiring users to interpret the image.

    Law of Proximity

    - Short Description: Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
    - Problem: The "CALL US" information is placed far from the main navigation menu, which might make it less noticeable for users looking to contact the company.
