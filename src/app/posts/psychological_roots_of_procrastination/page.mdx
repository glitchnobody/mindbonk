# STILL stuck at the starting Line: Psychological roots of procrastination.

**I've spent weeks, no, MONTHS telling myself I'd start this blog.**

I came up with topics, took hundreds of notes (not really), and kept researching the perfect way. But every time I sat down to write, I pushed the deadline a little further, you know, to ‚Äúprepare‚Äù a little more and ‚Äúplan‚Äù a little better. Turns out it was just procrastination disguised as ‚Äúthe search to find the perfect way‚Äù.

Hi, I'm Priyamvada, an aspiring mental health professional. Welcome to MindBonk! A space where we'll discuss the fascinating (and sometimes frustrating) ways our minds work.

We, (me, it's just me) at MindBonk are here to make psychology and mental health insightful, practical, and accessible(and fun, of course). From decoding the psychology of a fictional character to exploring the science behind daily behaviors, join us for a trip down the captivating road of the human mind.

But for now, let me tell you how I fell into the very trap I'm gonna talk about, PROCRASTINATION, and how I got rid of it.

## **The Procrastination Trap: Why We Delay Taking the First Step**

Starting a task, big or small, whether it's writing your first blog (like this one), joining the gym, or writing that huge assignment, can feel overwhelming. We plan, prepare, and convince ourselves we're being productive... yet somehow, we never actually _start_.

This is what psychologists call the **Intention-Action Gap,** the period between deciding to do something and doing it. This is one of the most common reasons why that very first, seemingly easy step feels like the hardest. Have you ever wondered why this happens? Here's what's at play:

This divided hourglass represents how procrastination disrupts the ideal timeline and leaves you stuck in a zero productivity zone.

### 1. Perfectionism Paralysis

Illusion of the "Perfect First Step‚Äù

I believed that my first blog post had to be flawless. But this mindset only made me **paralyzed** and delayed the desired action. I realized, ‚ÄúWanting perfect results on your first try keeps you stuck in an endless loop of preparing, instead of executing‚Äù.

[A study by Colleen R. Sayers (2003)](https://www.proquest.com/openview/b7c0a0d66892bb13f488c848abaa17c7/1?cbl=18750&diss=y&pq-origsite=gscholar) suggests that Perfectionism stems from the fear of not meeting social standards, other people's perceived expectations, or even our own personal (unrealistic) standards.

‚ÄúPerfectionism may affect the completion of a project‚Äù. Hollender (1978) defined perfectionism as the ‚Äúpractice of demanding of oneself or others a higher quality of performance than is required by the situation.‚Äù In my case, I didn't have to write the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù first blog; I just had to write _a_ blog. This situation required me just to write a blog and get over the hardest part, the _first step._

### 2. Choice overload

The only downside of complete control over something is having to make every tiny decision yourself. From blog niche and website design to color palettes and numerous writing styles, I was stuck making decisions rather than writing. I love having complete liberty over my projects; that's when I'm the most creative. But honestly, having fewer options to choose from would've made it easier, and I could get to actual writing quicker.

[A study on Choice Overload](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mark-Lepper-2/publication/12189991_When_Choice_is_Demotivating_Can_One_Desire_Too_Much_of_a_Good_Thing/links/56107d7d08ae6b29b49c75fa/When-Choice-is-Demotivating-Can-One-Desire-Too-Much-of-a-Good-Thing.pdf?origin=publication_detail&_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uRG93bmxvYWQiLCJwcmV2aW91c1BhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbiJ9fQ&__cf_chl_tk=9TsXpYsjsRYhoy3NZW_lMn4cSB1xs42IYLi00HRgCGk-1742710205-1.0.1.1-xsxT2rmSZREdzpw70vSjtvxlrxR0CupdJI1WhE.UDmY) suggests that, even in a place where we must choose between two positive options, having multiple appealing choices doesn't always make the decision easier. Instead, too many positive options, each with its own attractive features, can make people feel both drawn to and hesitant about making a choice. This results in demotivation, making them abandon the task itself.

<aside>
  üí° The **paradox of choice** [(Schwartz,
  2004)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-13971-000) : suggests that having
  too many options can lead to decision fatigue, making it harder to take the
  first step.

### 3. Fear of Failure

On some level, I worried that if this first post didn't turn out great, people might think I wasn't good enough to talk about psychology. Ironically, by not starting, I was guaranteeing failure anyway. [A 2022 study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-13971-000) suggested that there is a significant positive correlation between fear of failure and overall procrastination. During which something more interesting came to light about procrastination. Researchers found a correlation between total fear of failure and _decisional_ procrastination. Which means, people who fear failure may tend to delay or avoid making decisions on purpose.

Another fascinating connection was found between fear of interesting people losing interest in one, and procrastination. In this case, what my readers think of my content was of utmost priority, and the thought of them losing attention and curiosity, in turn, made me completely avoid putting myself out there.

### 4. The Brain's Love For Instant Gratification

Let's face it, the dopamine hit from scrolling through Instagram feels so much easier and satisfying than from going through a long, challenging task. This happens because our brain is wired for seeking instant reward over delayed gratification, even when the delayed reward is much more meaningful and satisfying.

[Research by Piers Steel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6598646_The_nature_of_procrastination_a_meta-analytic_and_theoretical_review_of_quintessential_self-regulatory_failure_Psychol_Bull_133_65-94) in 2007 found that tasks that seem difficult, unclear, or deliver delayed gratification are more likely to be postponed.

Fact-checking every little detail, writing a comprehensive blog, all while maintaining a personal style (any of which I had never done before) seemed like a really unpleasant task, and I kept focusing on more instant-reward actions like designing social media visuals and listing future blog topics. I was drawn to quick, less meaningful tasks rather than completing something that would bring me prolonged confidence and fulfilment.

## How To ACTUALLY Get Stuff Done

### Start with the WHY?

Before you Google another productivity hack, _ask yourself:_

Why does this matter to me?

Tap into the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù part of all the things you promised yourself you'll achieve. Slow down, take a breath, and carefully think about the rewards that come from completing that certain goal. Use your _why_ as fuel, because reasons reap results. Sometimes you don't lack motivation‚Äîit's _clarity_ that's missing.

1. Break It Down

You see a delicious pizza on your table. You wouldn't eat it whole, would you? You'd take it apart and savor it slice by slice. Now break your big, overwhelming tasks exactly like that. Break them into small, manageable chunks. When you have a list of bite-sized actions, you're more likely to execute them and feel productive without burning out.

2. Make It Exist First. You Can Make It Good Later

I wish someone had made me say this line to myself until it registered. This little tip goes a long way and applies to almost anything you'd like. The second I focused more on making the article EXIST first, things got a little easier. Now I wasn't focused on perfect words but on conveying my ideas clearly to you. It made a long, confusing task easier to execute. This post might not be perfect, but it's written, and that's what matters in the beginning. Progress > Perfection.

3. The Zeigarnik Effect

[The Zeigarnik effect](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-10344-025), discovered by Bluma Zeigarnik, describes the habit of remembering incomplete tasks over complete ones. This keeps us in the mental loop of remembering interrupted/unfinished tasks, and makes us more likely to finish them.

Pro tip: If you're also a case of ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù, try using sticky notes, whiteboards, or widgets on your phone for to-do lists. A constant visual reminder makes it harder for us to forget tasks.

4. Be Kind To Yourself

This might sound like another tangent, but it's a very important step. Being hard on yourself, over not getting something done, may seem like an act of disciplining yourself, but it actually has the opposite effect. If you're kinder and more patient with yourself, you are more likely to complete the work you put off. Because this time you'll be driven by your goals, not your guilt. Self-compassion keeps us optimistic yet grounded in reality. Acknowledge the gaps in your actions, but don't let them define you.

### **Welcome to MindBonk!**

You've reached the end of this post, and that means I FINALLY wrote it. I somehow conquered my procrastination demon by learning more and talking about it. MindBonk is here for you, the same way‚Äî overcoming mental blocks, understanding your emotions better, or simply learning the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of behavior.

This is not just a blog, it's a space to explore, question, and sometimes even disagree. We won't be focusing on just textbook psychology, but also understand the _human_ in human behavior a little more.

So what have you been putting off? However big or small your goal is, I challenge you to take one tiny step today. It doesn't have to be perfect‚Äîit just has to be a _start_.
